# Natural Language Processing (NLP)  

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate text-based data.

## ðŸ“Œ Techniques Covered  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal  
- **Bag of Words (BoW) Model**  
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**  
- **Sentiment Analysis using NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier**  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for Text Generation**  

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Used  
- `Restaurant_Reviews.tsv` (Contains reviews labeled as positive or negative)  

## ðŸ“Œ Running the Algorithm  
1. **Navigate to the NLP subfolder**  
   ```bash
   cd Natural_Language_Processing
   ```
2. **Run the Python script**  
   ```bash
   python nlp.py
   ```
3. **View the results of sentiment classification.**

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements  
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk sklearn
