# Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group data points into clusters based on their similarities. Unlike classification, clustering does not rely on predefined labels but instead identifies patterns and structures within the dataset.

This folder contains implementations of different clustering algorithms:

## 📌 1. K-Means Clustering
- **Description:** K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into `K` distinct clusters.
- **Key Features:** Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters and visualizes the clusters along with their centroids.
- **Implementation:** Located in `Clustering/K_Means/`
- **Dataset Used:** `Mall_Customers.csv`

## 📌 2. Hierarchical Clustering (Coming Next)
- **Description:** Hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to determine cluster relationships.
- **Key Features:** Can be **Agglomerative** (bottom-up approach) or **Divisive** (top-down approach).
- **Implementation:** Located in `Clustering/Hierarchical/`
- **Dataset Used:** `Mall_Customers.csv`

📌 Running the Algorithms
1️⃣ Navigate to the Clustering folder
bash
Copy
Edit
cd Clustering
2️⃣ Run the Python script for the clustering method
bash
Copy
Edit
python kmeans.py       # Runs K-Means Clustering
python hierarchical.py  # Runs Hierarchical Clustering
3️⃣ Observe the results
Elbow method (for K-Means) helps find the optimal number of clusters.
Dendrograms (for Hierarchical Clustering) visualize the cluster merging process.
📌 Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the scripts:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn scipy
