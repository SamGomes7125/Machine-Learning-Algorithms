# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that finds a new feature space maximizing class separation.

## ðŸ“Œ Applications  
- Used in **classification problems** like face recognition  
- Helps **improve model accuracy** by removing noise  
- Reduces dimensions while keeping **class separability**  

## ðŸ“Œ Running the LDA Algorithm  
```bash
cd Dimensionality_Reduction/LDA
python lda.py
