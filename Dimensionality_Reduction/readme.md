# Dimensionality Reduction  

Dimensionality Reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information. This helps in improving model performance, reducing computation time, and handling the **curse of dimensionality**.

## ðŸ“Œ Techniques Covered  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**  
- **Kernel PCA (Non-linear PCA)**  

## ðŸ“Œ Applications  
- Used for data visualization in **high-dimensional datasets**  
- Improves performance of **classification and clustering algorithms**  
- Reduces overfitting by eliminating redundant features  

## ðŸ“Œ Running the Algorithm  
1. **Navigate to the Dimensionality Reduction folder**  
   ```bash
   cd Dimensionality_Reduction
   ```
2. **Run the Python script for PCA, LDA, or Kernel PCA**  
   ```bash
   python pca.py
   python lda.py
   python kernel_pca.py
   ```
3. **Observe the feature-reduced dataset and classification performance.**

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements  
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn
