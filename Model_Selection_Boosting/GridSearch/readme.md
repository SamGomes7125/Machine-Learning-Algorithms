# Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning

## ðŸ“Œ What is Grid Search?
Grid Search is an exhaustive search technique used to find the best hyperparameters for a model. It systematically goes through a predefined set of hyperparameter values and evaluates each combination.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Use Grid Search?
- Improves model performance by finding optimal parameters.
- Automates hyperparameter tuning instead of manual trial and error.
- Works with multiple ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest).

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run Grid Search?
1. **Navigate to the GridSearch folder**  
   ```bash
   cd GridSearch
