📌 XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework and is widely used for structured/tabular datasets.

🚀 Why XGBoost?
✅ Fast Execution – Uses parallel computing for speed.
✅ Regularization – Helps prevent overfitting.
✅ Handles Missing Values – Built-in feature to handle missing data.
✅ Optimized Performance – Works well with large datasets.
✅ Feature Importance – Provides insights into feature impact.

🔹 Applications
📌 Used in Kaggle competitions for structured data tasks.
📌 Applied in finance, healthcare, fraud detection, and recommendation systems.
📌 Common in classification & regression problems.
