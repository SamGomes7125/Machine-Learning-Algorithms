# ðŸ§  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for **image classification, object detection, and feature extraction**. They work by **applying convolutional layers** that learn patterns from images, allowing the model to recognize objects efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Architecture  
A typical CNN consists of the following layers:  
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract features from images.  
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality and retain important features.  
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Perform classification based on extracted features.  

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset Used  
- **Dataset:** Image dataset (e.g., Cats vs. Dogs, MNIST, CIFAR-10)  
- **Format:** Images stored in **train/test folders**  
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization  

## ðŸ“Œ Running the CNN Model  
1. **Navigate to the CNN folder**  
   ```bash
   cd Deep_Learning/CNN
