# ðŸ§  Deep Learning  

Deep Learning is a subset of **Machine Learning** that focuses on neural networks to model complex patterns in data. It is widely used in **computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning**, and other AI applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Techniques Covered  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  

## ðŸ“Œ Applications  
- **ANNs:** Used for structured data, regression, and classification tasks.  
- **CNNs:** Specialized in image processing, object detection, and pattern recognition.  

## ðŸ“Œ Running the Algorithms  
1. **Navigate to the Deep Learning folder:**  
   ```bash
   cd Deep_Learning
   ```
2. **Run the Python script for ANN or CNN:**  
   ```bash
   python ANN/ann.py
   python CNN/cnn.py
   ```
3. **Observe training progress, accuracy, and predictions.**  

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements  
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
