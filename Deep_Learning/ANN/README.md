ðŸ§  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of neurons that process data and identify patterns. ANNs are widely used for classification, regression, and deep learning applications.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)
Backpropagation and Gradient Descent
Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax)
Optimizers (Adam, SGD)
Binary & Multi-class Classification using ANN
ðŸ“Œ Applications
Customer churn prediction
Medical diagnosis (disease detection)
Stock market price prediction
Image and speech recognition
ðŸ“Œ Running the ANN Model
Navigate to the ANN folder
bash
Copy
Edit
cd Deep_Learning/ANN
Run the Python script for ANN
bash
Copy
Edit
python ann.py
Observe the model training process and results.
ðŸ“Œ Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

bash
