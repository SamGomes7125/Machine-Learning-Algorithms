# Association Rule Learning (ARL)

Association Rule Learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to discover interesting relationships, or "rules," between variables in large datasets. It is commonly applied in market basket analysis, where businesses identify product associations based on customer purchasing behavior.

This folder contains implementations of the two main association rule learning algorithms:

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Apriori Algorithm  
- **Description:** Apriori is an algorithm that finds frequent item sets in a transactional dataset and derives association rules based on confidence, support, and lift.  
- **Key Features:** Uses a breadth-first search strategy and the "Apriori property" to prune infrequent itemsets.  
- **Implementation:** Located in `Association_Rule_Learning/Apriori/`  
- **Dataset Used:** `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`  

## ðŸ“Œ 2. Eclat Algorithm (Coming Next)  
- **Description:** Eclat (Equivalence Class Clustering and Bottom-Up Lattice Traversal) is an alternative to Apriori that uses a depth-first search strategy for faster rule mining.  
- **Key Features:** More memory efficient as it uses intersection-based set operations instead of candidate generation.  
- **Implementation:** Located in `Association_Rule_Learning/Eclat/`  
- **Dataset Used:** `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use  
Each algorithm has its own Python script and dataset inside its respective subfolder. You can run the scripts to generate association rules.

### Running an Association Rule Learning Algorithm:
1. **Navigate to the specific algorithm subfolder**  
   ```bash
   cd Association_Rule_Learning/Apriori
